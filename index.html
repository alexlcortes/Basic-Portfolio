			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="assets/images/IMG_0128.png" alt="Alejandro's Bio Image" border="0" />
				<p>My name is Alejandro Luis Cortes and I am an aspiring web developer. The things that drive me are my family, and doing the best work possible in what ever I do. I hope to one day develop websites and applications that make the internet a better place for all. My dream is to work and develop content for children that educates and entertains at the same time.</p>
				<p>I am a huge fan of comicbook movies and tv shows. I am also a fan of the comics themselves and have a respectable collection in boxes at home that I will never read again. I like to cook and most of the time do cook for my family (My son mostly). I have a twenty-month old son who likes to climb on everything and fall right after. If I can make his life better I will in any way I can.</p>
